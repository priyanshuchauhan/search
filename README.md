This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
earch engine:

## https://priyanshuchauhan.github.io/se...

## Start app

Frontend and server runs from same command

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Or use the above URL (without PATCH operations)

Tesing

### `npm test`

1. create code snnipet:
	a. Add that minimal snippet to the project’s test suite, along with an assertion what the correct behavior should be. Make sure the test is red (fails).
	b. Integrate vscode browser:  possible suggestion and fixed code. JS can run in browser for other programming languges premium

2. search symentic analysis

3. API integration:
	a. GIT issues
	b. documentations popularity on maven and npm etc (like zeal or something similar): redirect to similar point on documentation or 
	c. node modules
	d. inside the codebase (show as a different category of result)

4. popular library solution should we given higher weight

5. web crawler: later

6. UI: clean UX with duck duck go like search with filters like select programming lanugae

7. "Fix the error, using some good old-fashioned science - build hypothesis, make prediction, do experiment (might involve using an interactive debugger), analyze outcome. If prediction disagrees with outcome - refine or discard hypothesis and start over."


8. Test cases: auto build new test cases:
	a. Make sure the test is now green (passes). previously test case should fail

9. create good auto documentation for code also.

10. search for ML to auto-generate codebase etc.

11. cool quotes/meme on homepage like: "Programmer don’t learn things until they realize they didn’t learn them."
	meme could be crawled from instagram

12. Offline search support using zeal like version, PWA (maybe)

13. Results in multiple categories:
	a. web search
	b. codebase
	c. issues
	d. vscode code example
	e. sample code
	f. blogs
